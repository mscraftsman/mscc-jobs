We are APSCo accredited and pride ourselves on our commitment to the safeguarding of all of our teaching and support staff. All of our adverts relate to active vacancies.     <br/>Due to a huge demand from schools across Sussex and Kent , we are now looking to expand our pool of talented Supply Teachers who are looking for flexible work that coincides with their other commitments.  Following a rapid expansion in 2017-2018, we are now receiving calls every morning from Primary, Secondary and SEN schools across both counties who are looking for adaptable Supply Teachers to assist with general cover.  <br/>From September 2018, we are looking to introduce ‘Guaranteed Supply Contracts’ for a number of our Supply Teachers who are looking for guaranteed work at least 3 days a week. The objective of this is to ensure that you will receive work on your available days, and if we can’t find you work we’ll pay you anyway! (T&C’s apply)   <br/>  <br/>What your day will involve:  <br/>·         Working 8:30- 15:30 (subject to school timetable)  <br/>·         Covering classes in a Teachers absence. This can be general cover or subject specific, depending on your preference.  <br/>·         NO PLANNING!   <br/>·         The support of at least 1 TA in your classroom.  <br/>  <br/>Why 3D Recruit:  <br/>·         Free to join!  <br/>·         Daily support from our experienced consultants from 6am-11pm  <br/>·         We are a local, family run agency! Unlike many corporate agencies in the big cities, we are based in the local village of Battle, meaning that our candidates can pop in at any time should they need assistance. We also spend a lot of time within our schools, meaning that we can provide an honest account of what to expect.   <br/>·         Access to many FREE CPD events!   <br/>·         Excellent daily rates of pay  <br/>  <br/>Should you be interested in joining our team of Supply Teachers in Sussex & Kent, please get in touch with Poppy at 3D Recruit today! <span></span></p>",
